<h3>Debbs</h3>

Life of a programmer revolves around coding. Writing,compiling and testing code then writing again.

This coding  process may take time and can be tiring and  stressful, for example if you are working with languages like java , go , c# , c++ or c etc... , where you have to compile a source code then run its byte code or an executable hence repeating the same procedure again and again anytime you make an error or did not achieve desired results.

I wrote a bash a script to help me do all that

You run debbs and pass in a few arguments and let it do the magic . Give a file you want to open or if it doesn't exist the name you want to refer to it , editor you want to use for the job (optional) , whether to save the file or not once you are done with it or not (optional) , run on real mode (optional).

<b><i>Now comes the fun part </i></b>, debbs starts a session ,opens  the editor and once you're done coding. The moment you exit the editor it runs the file with correct run type procedure for the language you are using. Helps in any case you forget its run type procedure or you want to avoid a lot of typing like me üòÇ üòÇ.

<b><i> Awesome </i>.</b>
It then outputs the code results after compilation and run time.It has a  Real mode option which enables you can see code output while writing code itself.<b> Think of it as a live server  </b> üòÇ üòÇ

<b><i>This whole process happens very fast </i></b> . üëç Saves you a lot of time and will reduce your stress level trust me . üòÇ üòÇ

<h3>Installation </h3>

Clone debbs repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Brian254ke/debbs.git
```

Go to the directory where you've cloned debbs repository .

Give debbs script execute permission

```
chmod +x debbs.sh
```

Add a symlink so that you can use debbs anywhere on the path in the terminal.

```
n=`pwd` | ln -sf   $n/debbs.sh     /usr/bin/debbs
```

If you don't want to add debbs to path . You will need to use absolute path whenever you want to use it .

ie ${PATH TO DEBBS} now do something with debbs.

     /home/pathtodebbs  --help

or

If you are on the same directory you can use it as follows :

     ./debbs.sh -f test.js

<h3>Usage</h3>

Using debbs is very easy. You need to memorize only a few  flags to pass in arguments.

| -us  | --usage   | See usage examples .                                         |
| -f   | --file    | Opens this files in an editor , creates it if doesn't exist  |
| -s   | --save    | Include option to remove the file at the end of the session. |
| -e   | --editor  | Specify the editor to use                                    |
| -o   | --output  | Redirect errors and output to a file.                        |
| -r   | --real    | Include option to enable real mode                           |

While using light weight editors such as vim or nano or vi dont enable real mode but if you are using sublime text or vs code or atom or notepad or maybe notepad++ etc... You can use real mode.
enabled but terminate the process on the terminal once you are done hit ctr +c twice or if you forget to terminate the program, it exits after 3 minutes of inactivity.

<h4>Where can I use it ?</h4>
